          This is my first notebook entry.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm actually hard-coding this entry intially, though in the near future, I'm planning to have a remote CMS spun up to handle the actual running content here.

          As the title above indicates, this it just a way for me to actually get out of the infinite cycle of planning and preparing I've been stuck in, and get this project live.

          It's not pretty, or complex at the moment, but here it is.
