# Hello World!
*2023-07-03*

This entry is officially my first of hopefully many, many projects and pages.

## Main goal:
This project has one simple goal: start my online engineering journal (blog), to begin to establish some structure for logging my personal projects and process, while building out my portfolio in the process.

## Sub-goals:
Practice the following technologies:
- [ ] GitHub Pages
- [X] GitHub Codespaces
- [X] Markdown
- [X] Jekyll
- [ ] Domain URL linking
- [ ] Get emojis working

As an added bonus, I'm currently buidling this completely on my iPad, which means I'll be able to learn and practice all the skills needed to build future projects on the go!

I'm actually pretty excited to find out that I can spin up full dev environments complete in the browser. My mind is spinning with the possibilities!

I'm going to continue to update below as I work through the process.

## Process:
1. First thing I did was to clear out the old contents of this repo, so I could reinitialize it as simply as possible
2. I then learned I needed to initialize a new codespace server, so I could properly start using the browser version of VS Code as a full dev environment
3. While trying to install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/), I was running into permissions errors in the terminal. Using `sudo` seems to fix the problem.
4. Had to read through the docs to see how all of the site configuration works. I'll have to delve a bit deeper into everything as I continue to build this site out.
5. After serving the site "locally", there's a bunch of default config blocks I'll need to update, but I was able to adjust some of them pretty easily, and can see where I need to tweak things to get the others where they're needed.
6. This is going to be fun!

## Revelations:
1. simply pulling up the VS Code editor in a repo (in the browser using the `.` key) is not the same as spinning up a full dev environment using codespaces
2. trying to install new items in a codespace seems to always require the `sudo` command, lest permissions issues be encountered
3. getting one's hands dirty by just experimenting is important, but it often pays to just take some time to read the docs early on in experimentation
