# Hello World!
*2023-07-03*

This entry is officially my first of hopefully many, many projects and pages.

## Main goal:
This project has one simple goal: start my online engineering journal (blog), to begin to establish some structure for logging my personal projects and process, while building out my portfolio in the process.

## Sub-goals:
Practice the following technologies:
- GitHub Pages
- GitHub Codespaces
- Markdown
- Jekyll
- Domain URL linking

## Process:
As an added bonus, I'm currently buidling this completely on my iPad, which means I'll be able to learn and practice all the skills needed to build future projects on the go!

I'm actually pretty excited to find out that I can spin up full dev environments complete in the browser. My mind is spinning with the possibilities!

I'm going to continue to update below as I work through the process.

## Revelations:
1. simply pulling up the VS Code editor in a repo (in the browser using the `.` key) is not the same as spinning up a full dev environment using codespaces
2. trying to install new items in a codespace seems to always require the `sudo` command, lest permissions issues be encountered
3. getting one's hands dirty by just experimenting is important, but it often pays to just take some time to read the docs early on in experimentation
