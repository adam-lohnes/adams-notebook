# Adam's Notebook

This is the source code for my personal blog, Adam's Notebook. The blog is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Structure

- `index.html` - The homepage
- `posts.html` - List of all blog posts
- `about.html` - About me page
- `css/` - CSS stylesheets
- `js/` - JavaScript files
- `posts/` - Individual blog post HTML files
- `images/` - Images used in the blog

## Local Development

To run this site locally, simply clone the repository and open `index.html` in your web browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/adams-notebook.git
cd adams-notebook
# Open index.html in your browser

## Deployment

This site is deployed using GitHub Pages. Any changes pushed to the main branch will be automatically deployed.

## Adding New Posts

To add a new blog post:

1. Create a new HTML file in the `posts/` directory
2. Use the existing post structure as a template
3. Add a link to the new post in `posts.html`
4. Add the post to the recent posts section in `index.html` if desired
