# Blog Structure Guidelines

## Project Overview
This is a personal blog called "Adam's Notebook" built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The blog focuses on software projects, AI thoughts, and miscellaneous life experiences.

## Directory Structure
- `/css`: Contains styling files (see @css/styles.css)
- `/js`: Contains JavaScript files (see @js/main.js)
- `/posts`: Contains blog posts organized by date (YYYY/MM/DD/title-slug.html)
- `/templates`: Contains templates for creating new posts (see @templates/post-template.html)
- `/drafts`: Contains draft posts in Markdown format (see @drafts/README.md)

## Content Structure
- Blog posts should be organized by date: `/posts/YYYY/MM/DD/title-slug.html`
- Each post should use the template structure from @templates/post-template.html
- Post metadata should include title, date, and description
- For examples, see:
  - @posts/2025/03/06/hello-world.html
  - @posts/2025/03/07/ethical-considerations-ai-development.html

## Path Handling
- Use relative paths instead of absolute paths for all links and resources
- For post files, use relative paths with the appropriate number of "../" to navigate up to the root
- In templates, use "ROOT_PATH" as a placeholder that will be replaced with the appropriate relative path
- Ensure all paths work both locally and when deployed to GitHub Pages or other hosting services
- For links between posts, use relative paths that navigate through the directory structure
