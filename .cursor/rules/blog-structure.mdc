# Blog Structure Guidelines

## Project Overview
This is a personal blog called "Adam's Notebook" built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The blog focuses on software projects, AI thoughts, and miscellaneous life experiences.

## Directory Structure
- `/src/app`: Contains Next.js App Router pages and layouts
- `/src/components`: Contains React components organized by category
- `/src/lib`: Contains utility functions and shared code
- `/prisma`: Contains database schema and migrations
- `/public`: Contains static assets like images and favicons
- `/drafts`: Contains draft posts in Markdown format

## Content Structure
- Blog posts are stored in the database and accessed via the App Router
- Posts are accessed via the `/posts/[slug]` route
- Each post has metadata including title, date, description, and tags
- The database schema includes models for Posts, Drafts, and Tags

## Routing Structure
- Home page: `/` (src/app/page.tsx)
- Posts index: `/posts` (src/app/posts/page.tsx)
- Individual post: `/posts/[slug]` (src/app/posts/[slug]/page.tsx)
- Tags page: `/tags` (src/app/tags/page.tsx)
- Tag filter: `/tags/[tag]` (src/app/tags/[tag]/page.tsx)
- About page: `/about` (src/app/about/page.tsx)

## Path Handling
- Use Next.js Link component for client-side navigation
- Static assets should be placed in the `/public` directory
- Images and other media should use the Next.js Image component when possible
- API routes are available under `/api` for dynamic data fetching
