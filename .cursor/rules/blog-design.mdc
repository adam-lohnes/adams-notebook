# Blog Design Guidelines

## Styling Guidelines
- Use the existing color scheme defined in CSS variables in @css/styles.css
- Support both light and dark themes
- Maintain responsive design for all screen sizes
- Keep styling consistent across all pages

## Navigation
- The site header ("Adam's Notebook") serves as the home link
- Navigation includes "All Posts" and "About" (which links to the Hello World post)
- The theme toggle button should always be present in the header
- See @index.html for reference implementation

## Post Cards
- Post cards should be fully clickable
- Cards should have a consistent design with title, date, description, and link
- Cards should have hover effects for better user interaction
- See @index.html for examples of post cards

## Footer
- Footer should be sticky to the bottom of the viewport when content is shorter
- Copyright year should be 2025
- Footer should be consistent across all pages
- See @templates/post-template.html for reference implementation

## Theme Toggle
- Support system preference detection for dark/light mode
- Provide a toggle button with sun/moon animation
- Persist user preference using localStorage
- Implementation in @js/main.js

## Lists
- Lists should have custom styling with primary color bullets/numbers
- Proper spacing and indentation for better readability
- Consistent styling for both ordered and unordered lists
- See @css/styles.css for implementation

## Favicon
- Use the notebook-style favicon for all pages
- Black/dark grey notebook design with white pages and darker rule lines
- Include SVG version for modern browsers (@favicon.svg)
- Include PNG fallbacks (32x32, 192x192, 512x512) in @favicon/ directory
- Include proper Apple touch icon
- Include @site.webmanifest for PWA support
- Favicon links should be placed in the head section after meta tags and before stylesheets
