# Blog Content Guidelines

## Citations and References
- Academic-style articles should include proper citations
- Citations should be formatted as superscript links with the class "citation"
- Citations should link to the references section using anchor links
- The references section should have the ID "references"
- Each reference item should have a unique ID for linking
- Citations should use the primary blue color to stand out
- References should include proper links to external sources when available
- Citation format should follow the pattern: (Author, Year)
- References should be listed in a consistent format with proper spacing
- For an example, see @posts/2025/03/07/ethical-considerations-ai-development.html

## Creating New Posts
1. Start by creating a draft in the `/drafts` folder using Markdown format
2. Use the frontmatter template from @drafts/README.md
3. Develop and refine the content in Markdown
4. When ready, convert to HTML using the structure in @templates/post-template.html
5. Place in the correct date-based directory: `/posts/YYYY/MM/DD/`
6. Update @index.html and @posts.html with links to the new post

## Content Planning
- Maintain a list of article ideas in @drafts/article-ideas.md
- Organize draft posts with appropriate frontmatter including status
- Use the drafts folder for developing content before publishing
- Follow the publishing checklist in @drafts/README.md
- Aim for a mix of technical, AI-related, and personal content
- For draft examples, see:
  - @drafts/ai-tools-changing-workflow.md
  - @drafts/digital-minimalism.md
