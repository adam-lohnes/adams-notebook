# Blog Content Guidelines

## Citations and References
- Academic-style articles should include proper citations
- Citations should be formatted as superscript links
- Use the `<cite>` element for citations when appropriate
- References should be listed in a consistent format with proper spacing
- Citation format should follow the pattern: (Author, Year)
- References should include proper links to external sources when available

## Creating New Posts
1. Start by creating a draft in the `/drafts` folder using Markdown format
2. Use the frontmatter template from `drafts/README.md`
3. Develop and refine the content in Markdown
4. When ready, import the draft into the database using `npm run import:drafts`
5. The draft will be automatically post-processed and moved to the appropriate subdirectory
6. Update the status in the database to publish the post

## Draft Organization
- Drafts are organized into subdirectories based on their status:
  - `/drafts`: New drafts and those in initial development
  - `/drafts/in-progress`: Drafts that are actively being worked on
  - `/drafts/published`: Drafts that have been published as posts
  - `/drafts/ideas`: Article ideas and planning documents
- The post-processing script automatically moves drafts to the appropriate directory
- Use `npm run post-process:drafts` to manually trigger post-processing

## Content Planning
- Maintain a list of article ideas in `drafts/ideas/article-ideas.md`
- Organize draft posts with appropriate frontmatter including status
- Use the drafts folder for developing content before publishing
- Follow the publishing checklist in `drafts/README.md`
- Aim for a mix of technical, AI-related, and personal content
- For draft examples, see:
  - `drafts/ai-tools-changing-workflow.md`
  - `drafts/digital-minimalism.md`

## Content Categories
- Software Projects & Experiments
- Creative Projects & Experiments
- AI Thoughts & Analysis
- Books & Learning
- Productivity & Personal Growth
- Miscellaneous

## Markdown Formatting
- Use proper Markdown syntax for headings, lists, and code blocks
- Code blocks should specify the language for syntax highlighting
- Use front matter for metadata (title, description, date, tags)
- Images should be placed in the public directory and referenced with relative paths
- Use proper heading hierarchy (# for title, ## for sections, etc.)

## Drafts Format
```yaml
---
title: "Article Title"
description: "Brief description of the article"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
status: draft|in-progress|ready
---
```
