# Blog Drafts Guidelines

## Structure
- Use Markdown (`.md`) files for drafts
- Name files with a descriptive title: `article-title-slug.md`
- Include frontmatter at the top of each file with metadata
- See @drafts/README.md for complete instructions

## Frontmatter Template
```yaml
---
title: "Article Title"
description: "Brief description of the article"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
status: draft|in-progress|ready
---
```

## Workflow
1. Create a new draft in the drafts folder
2. Develop and refine the content
3. When ready, convert to HTML using @templates/post-template.html
4. Move to the appropriate date folder in `/posts/YYYY/MM/DD/`
5. Update @index.html and @posts.html with links to the new post
