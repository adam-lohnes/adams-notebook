# Blog Drafts Guidelines

## Directory Structure
- `/posts`: Root directory for all pubished blog posts

## Structure
- Use Markdown (`.md`) files for posts
- Name files with a descriptive title: `article-title-slug.md`
- Include frontmatter at the top of each file with metadata

## Frontmatter Template
```yaml
---
title: "Article Title"
description: "Brief description of the article"
date: 'YYYY-MM-DD' # always check it in the terminal for today's proper date
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3, etc.]
status: draft|ready
heroImage: "/images/posts/[post-slug-based-on-title].png"
---
```

## Workflow
1. Create a new draft in the posts folder
2. Develop and refine the content
3. When ready, update the draft status to "ready"

## Publishing Checklist
- [ ] Proofread content
- [ ] Add appropriate citations and references
- [ ] Include a relevant hero image (to add in the frontmatter only) and content images, where appropriate
  - [ ] create a secondary file `/docs/social-media/[post-slug]-image.md` containing AI prompts for generating all images
- [ ] Format code snippets properly
- [ ] Add meta description
- [ ] Set appropriate tags
- [ ] Update status to "ready"
- [ ] generate 5 posts for Twitter and 1 LinkedIn post to promote the new blog article
  - [ ] add them to `/docs/social-media/[post-slug]-promotion.md`
