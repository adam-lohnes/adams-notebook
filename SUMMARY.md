# Update Protocol Book Project Implementation

## Overview of Changes

I've implemented the following features and components for your "Update Protocol" book project:

1. **Enhanced Markdown Loader** - Added support for projects, chapters, and book reading in `src/lib/markdown-loader.ts`

2. **Project Component Structure**:
   - `src/components/ui/ProjectCard.tsx` - Card component to display projects on the homepage and projects page
   - `src/components/BookReader.tsx` - Reader component with navigation, table of contents, and font size controls

3. **Pages and Routes**:
   - Homepage now includes a Projects section using `ProjectCard`
   - `/projects` - Projects listing page
   - `/projects/[slug]` - Project detail page showing the book information
   - `/projects/[slug]/reader` - Book reader entry point that redirects to the first chapter
   - `/projects/[slug]/reader/[chapter]` - Individual chapter reader

4. **Storage and User Preferences**:
   - Added cookie consent banner in the reader layout 
   - Implemented localStorage-based reading progress tracking
   - Added font size preference saving
   - Added keyboard navigation support (left/right arrows to change chapters)

5. **Content Preparation**:
   - Added frontmatter to the blog post about the book development
   - Added frontmatter to the project description page
   - Added frontmatter to the first chapter (you'll need to add similar frontmatter to other chapters)

## How to Use

1. **Adding Chapters**: All chapter files should be in the `projects/update-protocol-book/` directory, formatted as `chapter_1.md`, `chapter_2.md`, etc.

2. **Chapter Frontmatter**: Each chapter should have frontmatter with at least a title:
   ```
   ---
   title: "Chapter Title"
   ---
   ```

3. **Cover Image**: Place your cover image at `/public/images/projects/update-protocol-cover.jpg` when it's ready

## Next Steps

1. Add frontmatter to all remaining chapters
2. Create a proper cover image
3. Test all reader functionality, especially the navigation and table of contents
4. Review the cookie consent implementation to ensure it meets your requirements
