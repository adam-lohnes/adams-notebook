            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>As artificial intelligence continues to reshape our world, those of us involved in its development face increasingly complex ethical questions. While organizations and governments work to establish regulatory frameworks, each developer must also confront personal decisions about the work they're willing to do and the boundaries they need to set. This article explores how we can develop our own ethical frameworks for AI development and establish personal boundaries that align with our values.</p>
            
            <p>My interest in this topic stems from reading works like Max Tegmark's "Life 3.0" and Nick Bostrom's "Superintelligence," which explore the profound implications of advanced AI. These books raise important questions about the future of humanity alongside AI, but they don't always address the immediate ethical dilemmas developers face in their day-to-day work. How do we translate these big-picture concerns into practical guidelines for our professional lives?</p>
            
            <h2>The Spectrum of AI Ethics</h2>
            <p>[This section will explore the range of ethical considerations in AI development, from immediate concerns about bias and privacy to longer-term existential questions. It will discuss how personal boundaries might differ depending on where one's work falls on this spectrum.]</p>
            
            <h2>Frameworks for Ethical Decision-Making</h2>
            <p>[This section will examine various ethical frameworks that can guide personal decision-making in AI development, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Consequentialism: Evaluating actions based on their outcomes</li>
                <li>Deontological ethics: Following moral rules and duties</li>
                <li>Virtue ethics: Developing character traits that lead to ethical behavior</li>
                <li>Care ethics: Emphasizing relationships and care for others</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The section will discuss how these frameworks can be applied to AI development scenarios.]</p>
            
            <h2>Core Principles for Personal Boundaries</h2>
            <p>[This section will propose a set of core principles that developers can use to establish their personal boundaries, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Transparency and explainability</li>
                <li>Fairness and non-discrimination</li>
                <li>Privacy and data protection</li>
                <li>Human oversight and agency</li>
                <li>Accountability for outcomes</li>
                <li>Environmental sustainability</li>
                <li>Social benefit and harm prevention</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each principle will be explored with practical examples of how it might influence personal boundaries.]</p>
            
            <h2>Drawing Your Own Lines: A Personal Exercise</h2>
            <p>[This section will provide a structured exercise to help readers identify their own ethical boundaries in AI development. It will include questions like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What applications of AI would you refuse to work on, regardless of the circumstances?</li>
                <li>What conditions would need to be met for you to work on ethically ambiguous projects?</li>
                <li>What safeguards would you insist on implementing in your AI systems?</li>
                <li>How would you respond if you discovered unintended harmful consequences from your work?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The section will emphasize that there are no universally "correct" answers, but that thoughtful consideration is essential.]</p>
            
            <h2>Navigating Organizational Contexts</h2>
            <p>[This section will address the challenges of maintaining personal ethical boundaries within organizational contexts. It will discuss:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How to communicate your boundaries effectively to employers and colleagues</li>
                <li>Strategies for influencing organizational policies and practices</li>
                <li>When and how to push back against ethically questionable directives</li>
                <li>The potential career implications of maintaining strong ethical boundaries</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The section will include practical advice for navigating these challenges.]</p>
            
            <h2>Case Studies: Personal Boundaries in Practice</h2>
            <p>[This section will present several case studies of developers who have faced ethical dilemmas in AI development and how they navigated them. These might include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A developer who refused to work on facial recognition technology for law enforcement</li>
                <li>A researcher who discovered bias in their algorithm and took steps to address it</li>
                <li>A team that implemented additional safeguards for an AI system with potential dual-use applications</li>
                <li>A whistleblower who exposed unethical AI practices within their organization</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each case study will highlight different approaches to establishing and maintaining personal boundaries.]</p>
            
            <h2>Evolving Boundaries in a Rapidly Changing Field</h2>
            <p>[This section will discuss how personal ethical boundaries may need to evolve as AI technology advances and new ethical challenges emerge. It will emphasize the importance of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Staying informed about AI developments and their ethical implications</li>
                <li>Engaging in ongoing reflection and reassessment of personal boundaries</li>
                <li>Participating in broader conversations about AI ethics</li>
                <li>Being willing to adjust boundaries as understanding deepens</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The section will frame ethical boundary-setting as an ongoing process rather than a one-time decision.]</p>
