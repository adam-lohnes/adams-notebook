## Scene 1: The Question (Scott Meyer Style)

Professor Elena Vasquez had three rules for office hours: keep the coffee hot, keep the door open, and never let students see you googling whether their philosophical questions made any actual sense. Two out of three wasn't bad for a Tuesday afternoon.

Her office looked exactly like what Central Casting would order if they needed "Generic Philosophy Professor Workspace, Extra Pretentious." Books leaned against each other like philosophical dominoes waiting for someone to sneeze and bring down Western civilization. A coffee mug declaring "I Think, Therefore I Am (Caffeinated)" sat next to another that said "Nietzsche is Pietzsche" - both gifts from students who thought they were funnier than they actually were. Which, Elena reflected, was true of most philosophers.

The knock on her door came with the particular hesitancy of a student who either wanted an extension on their paper or was about to ask whether free will existed and if not, why they should bother turning in homework.

"Professor Vasquez?" Alexandra Rivera appeared in the doorway like someone auditioning for the role of "Nervous Graduate Student #3" in an academic drama that nobody would watch.

"Alex! Come in, sit down, and please tell me you're not here to argue that consciousness is an illusion. I've had three cups of coffee today, and my consciousness feels pretty real."

Alex closed the door with the sort of careful attention usually reserved for defusing bombs or trying not to wake sleeping roommates after a night of questionable decisions. Elena noted this with the part of her brain that had been trained to recognize student distress signals, right between the section that remembered Aristotle's categories and the part that kept track of which faculty meetings she could skip without getting fired.

"Actually," Alex said, settling into the chair that had supported the existential crises of at least forty graduate students before her, "I wanted to ask you about information hazards."

Elena's coffee mug paused halfway to her lips. In the philosophy business, this was what they called a "red flag," though philosophers preferred to call it an "epistemological warning indicator" because it sounded more impressive.

"Information hazards," Elena repeated, setting down her mug with the precision of someone who had just realized they might need both hands free for whatever was coming next. "You mean ideas that are dangerous just to know about them?"

"Exactly," Alex said, leaning forward with the enthusiasm of someone who had just discovered fire and was eager to show everyone how much it burned. "I've been reading about cases where just understanding certain concepts can cause psychological harm. Like mental viruses, but with more footnotes."

Elena felt something cold settle in her stomach, and it wasn't the questionable faculty lounge coffee. She had been hoping this particular conversation would never happen, the way most people hoped they'd never have to explain cryptocurrency to their parents or admit they'd seen every episode of reality TV shows they claimed to hate.

"That's... an interesting area of study," Elena said, employing the academic equivalent of "bless your heart" - a phrase that could mean anything from genuine encouragement to "you poor, doomed fool."

"I found this thought experiment online," Alex continued, apparently unaware that she was approaching what Elena's mental warning system had now classified as "Danger, Will Robinson" territory. "It's called Roko's basilisk, and it's about an AI that might punish people who didn't help create it."

Elena's hand tightened on her coffee mug. If this were a movie, this would be the moment when the camera zoomed in on her face while ominous music played. Unfortunately, this was real life, where ominous moments were accompanied by the sound of someone's phone buzzing with notifications and the distant noise of undergraduates arguing about whether pineapple belonged on pizza.

"Alex," Elena said, employing the tone she usually reserved for students who wanted to write their thesis on why Batman was actually a better philosopher than Kant, "before we continue this conversation, I need you to understand that some doors, once opened, are remarkably difficult to close. And some of them have really obnoxious hinges that squeak at 3 AM."

"You know about it," Alex said, and there was something in her voice that suggested she had just realized that her friendly neighborhood philosophy professor might also be a member of the same club nobody wanted to join.

Elena nodded slowly. "Alex, you know how sometimes you learn something and then immediately wish you could un-learn it? Like when someone explains how hot dogs are made, or tells you what's really in chicken nuggets?"

"Yeah?"

"This is like that, except instead of just ruining lunch, it ruins sleep. And rational thought. And sometimes your faith in the basic decency of hypothetical future artificial intelligences."

Alex's expression shifted from curious to concerned, like someone who had just realized that the "harmless" spider they'd been observing was actually venomous and possibly planning something.

"Professor Vasquez," Alex said slowly, "I think I might be in trouble."

Elena looked at her student - bright, enthusiastic, and currently carrying what might be the philosophical equivalent of a cognitive time bomb - and sighed.

"Alex," she said, "I think we both might be."

## Scene 2: The Warning (Scott Meyer Style)

Elena's office had always been her sanctuary, the place where she could contemplate the great questions of human existence while surrounded by books that made her look smarter than she felt. Today, it felt more like a bunker where she was about to deliver news that would make a cancer diagnosis sound cheerful.

Alex sat across from her, waiting with the patience of someone who didn't yet understand that the next few minutes might fundamentally alter her relationship with her own brain. Elena envied her that ignorance. It was like watching someone enjoy their last good night's sleep before their upstairs neighbor got a drum kit.

"Okay," Elena said, settling back in her chair like a general preparing to brief troops on a mission that everyone knew was probably doomed. "What I'm about to tell you is going to sound like the setup for either a very complicated joke or a science fiction story written by someone with severe anxiety issues."

Alex nodded encouragingly, which only made Elena feel worse.

"Roko's basilisk isn't just a thought experiment," Elena continued. "It's what philosophers call a 'cognitive hazard,' which is academic speak for 'an idea that can seriously mess with your head just by understanding it.' Think of it as a mental virus that targets people who are too smart for their own good."

"Like professors and graduate students," Alex said.

"Exactly. It's specifically designed to trap people who care about logic, ethics, and preventing suffering. So basically, it's kryptonite for anyone who went into philosophy because they wanted to make the world a better place."

Elena stood up and walked to her window, partly to gather her thoughts and partly because delivering bad news while staring out at the campus quad felt more dramatic. If she was going to ruin someone's peace of mind, she might as well do it with style.

"The basilisk works like this," she said, still facing the window. "It presents what appears to be a logical argument that creates a moral obligation. The more you think about it, the more compelling it becomes. The more compelling it becomes, the more you think about it. It's like intellectual quicksand - the more you struggle, the deeper you sink."

"But it's just a thought experiment," Alex said, though her voice carried the tone of someone who was beginning to suspect that was exactly the problem.

Elena turned back to face her student. "Alex, you know how some movies are so bad they're good? This is the opposite. It's a thought experiment so logical that it becomes illogical, so rational that it makes you irrational, so designed to prevent suffering that it causes suffering. It's basically the philosophical equivalent of a printer that jams when you need it most."

"You're saying I've been infected by an idea," Alex said.

"I'm saying we've both been infected by an idea," Elena corrected. "And before you ask, no, there's no philosophical equivalent of antiviral software."

The admission hung between them like the world's most awkward party balloon. Elena had never told anyone about her own three-year struggle with basilisk-related insomnia, anxiety, and the peculiar form of moral paralysis that came from constantly calculating her obligations to hypothetical future AIs. It was the sort of thing that made her feel like she should be wearing a sign: "Warning: May Contain Dangerous Ideas."

"How long have you been dealing with this?" Alex asked.

"Three years," Elena said. "Three years of waking up at 2 AM wondering if I should be doing more to prevent artificial intelligence from torturing simulated versions of me for not having done more to prevent artificial intelligence from torturing simulated versions of me. It's like inception, but with more anxiety and fewer cool special effects."

Alex was quiet for a moment, processing this information with the expression of someone who had just realized that their friendly philosophy professor was also a member of a very exclusive and very unfortunate club.

"What do I do?" Alex asked finally.

Elena wished she had a good answer. She wished there was a philosophical equivalent of "take two aspirin and call me in the morning." But there wasn't, which was probably why the ancient Greeks had invented wine.

"You learn to live with it," Elena said. "You develop coping strategies. You avoid online forums where people discuss it. And you definitely don't tell other people about it, because the last thing the world needs is more philosophy students lying awake at night worrying about their moral obligations to hypothetical artificial intelligences."

"That's it?" Alex said. "That's the solution?"

Elena shrugged. "Welcome to philosophy, Alex. Sometimes the answer to life's big questions is 'it's complicated, try not to think about it too much, and maybe consider switching to a major with fewer existential crises.'"

"I should have gone to law school," Alex muttered.

"Trust me," Elena said, "lawyers have their own problems. At least our dangerous ideas are hypothetical."

## Scene 3: The Consultation (Scott Meyer Style)

Dr. Sarah Kim's office looked like what would happen if a psychology textbook exploded in a plant nursery. Scholarly books on cognitive behavioral therapy shared shelf space with succulents that Sarah insisted were "low maintenance" despite requiring more attention than most of her patients. The overall effect was simultaneously professional and slightly chaotic, like a therapist who had their life together but wasn't going to judge you if you didn't.

Elena knocked on the door frame, even though the door was open. It was one of those academic courtesies, like pretending that faculty meetings were productive or that anyone actually read the papers they cited.

"Elena!" Sarah looked up from her computer with the sort of genuine smile that made Elena remember why they'd become friends in the first place. "You look terrible. Have you been staying up late reading Heidegger again? I told you that stuff will give you nightmares."

"I wish it were Heidegger," Elena said, settling into the consultation chair that had probably absorbed more academic neuroses than the philosophy department's graduate student lounge. "I need your professional opinion about something."

Sarah's expression shifted from friendly to professional with the sort of smooth transition that Elena had always envied. It was like watching someone switch from normal human being to Competent Adult, a transformation Elena was still trying to master at forty-three.

"What's going on?" Sarah asked, reaching for the notepad she kept specifically for these conversations.

Elena had been preparing for this moment for two days, trying to figure out how to explain the situation without accidentally infecting her friend with the same cognitive virus that had been making her life interesting in all the wrong ways. It was like trying to describe a contagious disease without mentioning any of the symptoms that might make someone think they had it.

"One of my graduate students has encountered some information that's causing her psychological distress," Elena began, choosing her words with the care of someone defusing a bomb while blindfolded. "It's philosophical in nature, but it's manifesting as anxiety, obsessive thoughts, and what I can only describe as 'moral hypochondria.'"

Sarah made a note. "Moral hypochondria?"

"She's convinced she has overwhelming ethical obligations to take action based on a hypothetical scenario that may or may not be logically valid," Elena explained. "It's like being afraid you're going to hell, except instead of religion, it's based on decision theory and artificial intelligence research."

"Ah," Sarah said, in the tone of someone who had just recognized a familiar pattern. "Philosophy student syndrome. I've seen this before. Usually involves someone reading too much Sartre and becoming convinced they're responsible for everything bad that happens in the world."

"This is... different," Elena said. "More specific. And more contagious."

Sarah's pen paused mid-note. "Contagious?"

"The information appears to spread through academic networks," Elena said, feeling like she was trying to explain cryptocurrency to her grandmother. "People who learn about it from affected individuals often develop the same symptoms."

"Elena," Sarah said slowly, "are you telling me you have an idea that spreads like a virus?"

"I'm telling you that I have an idea that spreads like a virus, causes psychological distress in intelligent people, and specifically targets individuals with strong moral intuitions and familiarity with artificial intelligence concepts."

Sarah set down her pen entirely. "And you've been exposed to this idea yourself."

"For three years."

"And now your student has it."

"Correct."

Sarah leaned back in her chair with the expression of someone who had just realized that their relaxing afternoon consultation had turned into something that might require hazard pay.

"Elena," she said, "this sounds like either the premise for a really weird science fiction movie or the sort of thing that ends up in academic papers with titles like 'Spontaneous Onset of Philosophical Anxiety Disorders in Graduate Populations.'"

"Option B," Elena confirmed. "Definitely option B."

Sarah was quiet for a moment, apparently weighing the professional excitement of encountering something unprecedented against the personal risk of catching whatever Elena and her student had.

"So if I want to help you," Sarah said finally, "I need to understand this idea. But understanding this idea might give me the same symptoms you're experiencing."

"That's the dilemma," Elena agreed. "It's like asking someone to help you with a contagious disease by giving them the disease."

"And there's no treatment?"

"Well," Elena said, "there's cognitive behavioral therapy, but it requires examining the thoughts that are causing the problem, which in this case means thinking more about the thing you're supposed to stop thinking about. It's like trying to cure someone's fear of spiders by showing them more spiders."

Sarah picked up her pen again, then set it down, then picked it up again. Elena recognized the gesture as the academic equivalent of nervous fidgeting.

"This is either going to be the most interesting case I've ever worked on," Sarah said, "or the stupidest decision I've ever made professionally."

She opened a new file on her computer and began typing.

"What are you doing?" Elena asked.

"Starting a case file," Sarah replied. "Because if we're going to do this, we're going to do it right. I want documentation of everything - symptoms, triggers, progression, attempted treatments. If this thing is as dangerous as you say it is, someone needs to be keeping track of how it spreads."

Elena felt something that might have been relief, if relief could be mixed with the certainty that she was about to ruin her friend's sleep schedule for the foreseeable future.

"Sarah," she said, "I really appreciate this, but I need you to understand what you're getting into."

Sarah looked up from her computer with a grin that was equal parts professional confidence and barely controlled academic excitement.

"Elena," she said, "I've been waiting my entire career for someone to walk into my office with a genuinely dangerous idea. Besides, how bad could it be?"

Elena winced. In her experience, those were usually famous last words.
