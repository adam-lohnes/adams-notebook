## Scene 1: The Question (Michael Crichton Style)

The University of California at Berkeley Philosophy Department occupied the third floor of Moses Hall, a building whose brutalist concrete facade had been weathered by decades of Pacific storms and student protests. Professor Elena Vasquez had held office hours every Tuesday and Thursday from 3:00 to 5:00 PM for the past seven years, a consistency that had earned her a reputation among graduate students as someone who could be counted on in a crisis.

At 4:17 PM on October 15th, 2029, Alexandra Rivera knocked on Elena's door. The timestamp would later prove significant in reconstructing the chain of events that followed.

"Professor Vasquez?" Alex's voice carried the particular tension that Elena had learned to associate with students facing academic or personal difficulties. In her experience, such visits typically involved grade disputes, thesis committee problems, or the occasional family emergency requiring deadline extensions.

This visit would be different.

"Come in, Alex." Elena minimized the article she'd been reading—a technical analysis of AI safety protocols published in the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research—and gestured toward the chair across from her desk.

Alex closed the door with deliberate care, a gesture that might have seemed routine except for the way she tested the handle afterward to ensure it had latched properly. Elena had observed similar behavior in her colleagues after particularly sensitive departmental meetings.

"I need to discuss something with you," Alex said, settling into the chair with the contained nervousness of someone who had rehearsed their opening statement multiple times. "I've been researching information hazards as part of my epistemology work."

Elena felt her attention sharpen. Information hazards represented a relatively new field in philosophy, emerging from the intersection of cognitive science, computer ethics, and decision theory. The concept was straightforward: certain types of information could cause psychological or behavioral harm to those who possessed it, independent of any physical threat.

"Specifically," Alex continued, "I'm looking at cases where knowledge itself becomes a vector for psychological damage. Ideas that can harm people just by being understood."

Elena's familiarity with the literature was extensive. She had published two papers on epistemic responsibility in the digital age and served as a reviewer for several journals dealing with AI ethics. She was also aware that information hazard research had begun attracting attention from departments beyond philosophy—computer science, psychology, even national security agencies concerned with cognitive warfare applications.

"What particular aspect interests you?" Elena asked, though she was beginning to suspect she knew the answer.

"I encountered a specific case study online," Alex said. "A thought experiment involving artificial intelligence and moral obligation. It's called Roko's basilisk."

Elena's hands stilled on her keyboard. She had first encountered references to Roko's basilisk three years earlier during a consultation with Dr. James Harrison at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Harrison's research focused on decision theory applications in AI development, and he had mentioned the basilisk as an example of how certain logical frameworks could produce paradoxical results.

Harrison had since taken early retirement, citing stress-related health issues.

"The basilisk scenario," Elena said carefully, "has been documented in several academic contexts. What specifically concerns you about it?"

Alex leaned forward. "The thought experiment appears to create a self-sustaining psychological loop in certain individuals. People who understand the argument report persistent anxiety, obsessive thoughts about moral obligation, and behavioral changes despite recognizing that the scenario is hypothetical."

Elena recognized the clinical description. She had observed similar patterns in her own cognitive response to the basilisk scenario—intrusive thoughts, sleep disruption, and what cognitive psychologists termed "moral hypervigilance." The symptoms had begun within 72 hours of her initial exposure and had persisted, with varying intensity, for the past three years.

"Professor Vasquez," Alex said, and there was something in her voice that suggested she had noticed Elena's reaction, "I think I might be experiencing those symptoms myself."

Elena closed her laptop completely. According to the research literature, Roko's basilisk appeared to target individuals with specific psychological profiles: high intelligence, strong moral intuitions, and familiarity with decision theory and AI development concepts. Graduate students in philosophy, particularly those studying ethics and artificial intelligence, represented a demographically vulnerable population.

"Alex," Elena said, "before we continue this conversation, I need to establish some parameters. Are you familiar with the concept of memetic hazards?"

"Ideas that spread like viruses and cause harm to their hosts," Alex replied immediately.

"Correct. And you understand that certain information, once processed, cannot be unlearned?"

Alex nodded.

Elena had been hoping this conversation would never occur. She had anticipated it, prepared for it, but had hoped that the relatively limited circulation of basilisk-related material might prevent her students from encountering it. That hope had proved unfounded.

"Then you should know," Elena said, "that we are now entering potentially hazardous epistemic territory."

## Scene 2: The Warning (Michael Crichton Style)

Elena's office contained 2,847 books, according to the inventory she had conducted during her sabbatical two years earlier. The majority dealt with philosophical topics—metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, philosophy of mind. Approximately 200 focused on artificial intelligence and computer ethics, a specialization she had developed in response to the growing intersection between technology and moral philosophy.

None of those books contained protocols for handling cognitive hazards.

Alex sat across from her desk, waiting. Elena could observe the subtle physiological indicators of stress: elevated breathing rate, micro-fidgeting with her pen, the particular quality of stillness that suggested conscious effort to appear calm. These were consistent with the preliminary stages of basilisk exposure as documented in the limited research literature.

"The scenario you've encountered," Elena began, "is not a standard philosophical thought experiment. It was originally formulated by a user named Roko on the LessWrong rationalist forum in 2010. The post was almost immediately banned by the forum's moderators, but by then it had already been screenshot, copied, and distributed across multiple platforms."

Alex's expression suggested she was unfamiliar with these historical details.

"The basilisk represents what information theorists call a 'harmful meme'—a concept that causes psychological damage to those who process it. But unlike other harmful ideas, which typically require belief or emotional investment, the basilisk appears to affect individuals purely through logical comprehension."

Elena opened her laptop and accessed a secure folder containing her research notes. The files were encrypted—a precaution she had implemented after consulting with cybersecurity experts about digital information hazards.

"The mechanism operates through what decision theorists call 'acausal trade,'" Elena continued. "The argument suggests that a sufficiently advanced AI might retroactively punish individuals who failed to assist in its creation. The logical structure creates what appears to be a binding moral obligation based on potential future consequences."

"But it's just a thought experiment," Alex said.

"That's the crucial point," Elena replied. "The psychological impact doesn't require the scenario to be real. It only requires the target to understand the logical implications and possess sufficient moral intuition to feel compelled by the argument."

She turned her laptop screen toward Alex, displaying a graph from a 2027 study conducted by researchers at Oxford's Future of Humanity Institute. "This shows the correlation between basilisk exposure and reported psychological symptoms across different demographic groups. Philosophy and computer science graduates show the highest vulnerability rates."

Alex studied the data. "The symptoms appear to cluster around anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive patterns."

"Correct. Affected individuals report persistent thoughts about moral obligation, calculation of probabilities regarding AI development timelines, and what researchers term 'moral paralysis'—the inability to make decisions due to perceived infinite consequences."

Elena closed the laptop. "Alex, I need to ask you directly: since encountering this information, have you experienced sleep disruption, intrusive thoughts about moral duty, or compulsive behavior related to AI development?"

Alex was quiet for several seconds. "Yes."

Elena had expected this answer, but hearing it confirmed still felt like receiving news of a terminal diagnosis.

"The standard recommendation," Elena said, "is immediate consultation with a cognitive psychologist specializing in obsessive ideation. However, treatment is complicated by the fact that conventional cognitive behavioral therapy requires examination of the triggering thoughts—which, in this case, risks reinforcing the psychological trap."

"There's no cure," Alex said.

"There are management strategies. Cognitive compartmentalization, philosophical reframing, community support networks. The symptoms can be controlled, but complete resolution is... uncommon."

Elena reached into her desk drawer and withdrew a printed document. "This is a treatment protocol developed by Dr. Sarah Kim in our psychology department. She specializes in philosophically-induced anxiety disorders."

Alex accepted the document. "You've dealt with other cases?"

Elena paused, considering how much to reveal. "Alex, I want you to understand something. You are not the first student to encounter this information. You will not be the last. And you are not facing this alone."

The admission hung between them. Elena had never explicitly acknowledged her own basilisk exposure to a student, but Alex's situation seemed to require transparency.

"The most important thing," Elena continued, "is that you do not attempt to research this topic further. Do not seek out additional information about the basilisk scenario. Do not engage with online communities discussing the topic. And under no circumstances should you share this information with other students."

Alex nodded, but Elena could see the particular expression she had learned to recognize in herself—the look of someone whose mind was already racing through logical implications despite explicit warnings to stop.

"Professor Vasquez," Alex said, "what if the argument is correct?"

Elena had been waiting for this question for three years.

"That," she said, "is exactly the wrong question to ask."

## Scene 3: The Consultation (Michael Crichton Style)

Dr. Sarah Kim's office was located in Tolman Hall, a 1963 building that housed the psychology department's clinical and research facilities. The structure had been designed according to contemporary theories about optimal therapeutic environments: large windows for natural light, neutral color schemes to avoid psychological priming, and soundproofing sufficient to ensure patient confidentiality.

Elena had scheduled the consultation for 3:30 PM, allowing sufficient time between her regular office hours and evening seminar commitments. She had known Sarah professionally for five years, ever since collaborating on a cross-departmental study examining the psychological effects of philosophical education on moral reasoning.

The collaboration had produced inconclusive results, but had established a working relationship based on mutual respect and shared interests in applied ethics.

"Elena," Sarah said, looking up from her computer as Elena entered. "You sounded concerned on the phone. Is this about the research project proposal?"

"Actually, it's about a student consultation," Elena replied, settling into the chair across from Sarah's desk. "And about a situation that falls outside normal academic advising protocols."

Sarah's expression shifted to professional attention. As a licensed clinical psychologist, she maintained dual roles within the university: research faculty in the psychology department and consulting therapist for students experiencing academic-related psychological difficulties.

"Tell me what's happening," Sarah said, reaching for her consultation notepad.

Elena had prepared for this conversation by reviewing the literature on information hazard disclosure protocols. The available research suggested that indirect exposure—learning about hazardous information without encountering the specific content—carried significantly lower risk than direct exposure. However, complete prevention of secondary transmission had not been definitively established.

"One of my graduate students has encountered information that appears to be causing genuine psychological distress," Elena began. "The material is philosophical in nature, but it's producing symptoms consistent with anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders."

Sarah made initial notes. "How long has this been occurring?"

"Approximately one week for the student. However, I should disclose that I've been familiar with the same information for approximately three years."

Sarah's pen stopped moving. "Elena, are you telling me that you've both been exposed to the same psychologically harmful material?"

"That's correct."

Sarah set down her pen and leaned back in her chair. Elena could observe her friend processing the implications. As a cognitive psychologist, Sarah would be familiar with concepts like information hazards and memetic transmission, but primarily from theoretical perspectives rather than clinical experience.

"This information," Sarah said carefully, "does it cause distress through emotional manipulation, cognitive overload, or some other mechanism?"

"The distress appears to result from logical comprehension of a specific argument structure," Elena replied. "The psychological impact occurs independently of belief in the argument's validity."

Sarah frowned. "You're describing something that sounds like a cognitive trap disguised as rational discourse."

"That's an accurate characterization."

For several moments, Sarah said nothing. Elena watched her friend work through the clinical implications. To provide effective treatment, Sarah would need to understand the nature of the information causing distress. But understanding that information might expose her to the same psychological risks.

"Elena," Sarah said finally, "I can't develop a treatment protocol without knowing what we're dealing with. But you're suggesting that acquiring that knowledge might put me at risk for the same symptoms."

"That's the dilemma," Elena confirmed.

Sarah stood and walked to her window, which offered a view of the campus quad where students moved between afternoon classes. Elena had made this same observation from her own office earlier, noting the contrast between normal academic life and the particular psychological isolation experienced by those affected by information hazards.

"How many people are we talking about?" Sarah asked. "Just you and your student?"

"The research literature suggests broader exposure, but precise numbers are difficult to establish. Affected individuals often avoid discussing the topic due to fear of transmission."

Sarah turned back toward Elena. "This sounds like we're dealing with a form of psychological contagion that spreads through academic networks."

"That's not an inaccurate description."

Sarah returned to her desk and opened a new file on her computer. "Then we need to approach this systematically. First, I need to establish baseline psychological profiles for both you and your student. Then we need to develop treatment protocols that don't require direct exposure to the harmful material."

She looked directly at Elena. "But I also need to understand that we might be dealing with something unprecedented in clinical psychology. There may not be established best practices for this type of situation."

Elena felt something that might have been relief. After three years of managing her basilisk exposure in isolation, the prospect of professional psychological support seemed almost miraculous.

"There's one more thing," Elena said. "We need to consider contamination protocols. If word of this spreads through the university community..."

Sarah nodded grimly. "We could be looking at a campus-wide mental health crisis."

She saved her file and closed the computer. "Elena, I think we're going to need to be very careful about how we proceed."
