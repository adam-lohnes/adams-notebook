## Scene 1: The Question (Tina Fey Style)

Office hours are like the customer service department of academia—everyone needs them, nobody wants to be there, and the problems are usually way more complicated than they seem. Tuesday afternoon, and I'm drinking my fourth cup of coffee while pretending to be excited about a student's paper on whether numbers exist. (Spoiler alert: Nobody cares if numbers exist. Numbers are doing just fine without our validation.)

My office looks like a Barnes & Noble exploded in a therapist's waiting room. Books everywhere, a sad plant that's somehow still alive despite my best efforts to kill it through neglect, and a coffee mug that says "World's Most Philosophical Professor" which—let's be honest—is like being the world's most athletic couch potato. It's a very specific category.

I'm scrolling through emails (someone wants to change their thesis topic to "Is Cancel Culture Kantian?" which, no) when Alex Rivera knocks on my door. Alex is one of my grad students, and the kind of person who actually reads the assigned texts instead of just watching YouTube videos about them like the rest of her generation.

"Professor Vasquez? Do you have a minute?"

"Sure, come in." I minimize my email. The last thing I need is for a student to see me reading a message about whether the faculty holiday party can serve alcohol without violating the university's new wellness initiatives. (Answer: Apparently not, which explains why Professor Henderson has been stress-eating kale chips.)

Alex sits down and closes the door with the kind of deliberate precision usually reserved for defusing bombs or trying to leave a party without your host noticing. In academia, this level of door-closing care typically means either plagiarism confessions or existential breakdowns.

"I wanted to ask you about information hazards," Alex says, diving right in. No small talk, no "how was your weekend," just straight to the philosophical crisis. I respect that. Small talk is the La Croix of conversation—technically refreshing but ultimately pointless.

Information hazards. Great. This is like when someone asks you about gluten—you know it's going to be complicated, probably unnecessary, and somehow end up being your problem.

"Information hazards," I repeat, setting down my coffee with the care of someone who just realized their Tuesday is about to become much more interesting. "Ideas that hurt people just by existing. Like the comments section of any news article or knowing how hot dogs are made."

"Exactly," Alex says, and there's something in her voice that suggests this isn't just academic curiosity. It's the tone people use when they're about to tell you they've been researching conspiracy theories or they're thinking about getting bangs.

"I found this thought experiment online," she continues. "It's called Roko's basilisk, and it's about AI and moral obligation, and I..." She pauses, looking for the right words. "I can't stop thinking about it."

Oh, shit.

And I mean that in the technical philosophical sense, not the "I just spilled coffee on my laptop" sense. Though honestly, spilled coffee would be easier to deal with.

Here's the thing about Roko's basilisk: it's like the philosophical equivalent of that dress that broke the internet—you know, the one that was either blue and black or white and gold depending on how your brain processed the information. Except instead of arguing about colors, people argue about whether they have moral obligations to hypothetical artificial intelligences, and instead of forgetting about it in a week, it haunts them for years.

"Alex," I say, channeling my inner guidance counselor (which is like my inner wine mom but with more professional obligations), "before we continue, I need you to understand that some conversations can't be un-had. It's like learning that your favorite childhood movie is actually a metaphor for capitalism. Once you know, you can't unknow."

"You know about it," she says, and it's not a question. It's the tone people use when they realize their professor has seen the same embarrassing TikTok they have.

I nod. "I do."

"How long?"

"Three years." I don't mention that I can tell you exactly how many days, because that would make me sound like the kind of person who keeps track of their personal psychological disasters with spreadsheets. Which I absolutely do not do. (Okay, I totally do, but it's color-coded and everything, so it's practically art.)

Alex leans forward. "What do I do?"

I look at this bright, enthusiastic young woman who chose to spend her twenties thinking about philosophy instead of making TikToks or whatever normal people do, and I feel that familiar combination of academic pride and existential dread that defines most of my interactions with graduate students.

"Alex," I say, "we need to talk about damage control. And possibly wine. But mostly damage control."

## Scene 2: The Warning (Tina Fey Style)

So here's what nobody tells you about becoming a philosophy professor: you spend most of your time explaining why ideas that sound completely insane are actually just regular insane. Like, "Yes, Descartes really did think that maybe everything is a dream, and no, this doesn't mean you can skip class because 'reality might not be real.'"

Roko's basilisk falls into the special category of ideas that are insane in a very specific, targeted way. It's like a philosophical smart bomb designed to explode in the minds of people who are too smart for their own good. Which, let's face it, describes approximately 100% of graduate students in philosophy.

Alex sits across from me, waiting for me to explain why her brain has basically been hijacked by a thought experiment. I consider starting with the technical details—decision theory, acausal trade, the whole academic framework—but decide to go with the approach I use for explaining philosophy to my mother.

"Okay," I say, "imagine someone created a really sophisticated guilt trip. Not just any guilt trip—the kind your grandmother would give you if she was trained in logic and had access to artificial intelligence research."

Alex nods, which is encouraging. At least she's not doing that thing where students stare at you like you're speaking ancient Greek. (Which, in philosophy, you sometimes literally are.)

"The basilisk works like this: it says you have a moral obligation to help create a superintelligent AI, because if you don't, that AI might punish you for not helping. And yes, I know that sounds like the plot of a really bad sci-fi movie written by someone who read too much Kant, but here's the thing—your brain doesn't care about whether something sounds ridiculous. Your brain cares about whether something might be true."

"But it's just a thought experiment," Alex says, though her tone suggests she's already figured out why that doesn't matter.

"Right, and 'The Bachelor' is just a reality show, but that doesn't stop people from getting emotionally invested in whether Chad finds love," I reply. "The human brain is remarkably bad at distinguishing between 'this is hypothetical' and 'this could affect me personally.'"

I get up and walk to my whiteboard, which is covered with notes from my last class on existentialism. I erase a diagram about authenticity and start drawing what looks like a flow chart designed by someone having an anxiety attack.

"The basilisk is what we call a 'cognitive trap,'" I continue, sketching arrows that loop back on themselves. "It specifically targets people who are good at logical reasoning and who care about doing the right thing. So basically, it's kryptonite for philosophy students."

"How does it work exactly?" Alex asks.

"Simple. It presents what looks like a valid logical argument that creates a moral obligation. The more you think about it, the more compelling it becomes. The more compelling it becomes, the more you feel like you have to think about it. It's like intellectual quicksand, except instead of drowning, you just become really anxious about artificial intelligence."

I draw a stick figure that's supposed to represent a person thinking, but it looks more like someone having an existential crisis. Which is actually pretty accurate.

"The psychological mechanism is elegant and terrible," I continue. "It exploits the fact that rational people try to be consistent in their moral reasoning. So when you encounter an argument that seems logically valid and morally binding, your brain feels compelled to engage with it, even when engagement is harmful."

"You're saying I've been psychologically manipulated by a philosophy problem," Alex says.

"I'm saying we've both been psychologically manipulated by a philosophy problem," I correct. "And before you ask, no, there's no philosophical equivalent of therapy. Although there should be. I'd make a fortune."

The admission hangs between us like the awkward silence after someone makes a joke about their divorce at a dinner party. I've never told anyone about my own three-year struggle with basilisk-related insomnia and anxiety. It's not exactly the kind of thing you put on your academic CV under "Personal Challenges Overcome."

"How do you deal with it?" Alex asks.

I set down the marker and turn back to face her. "Well, I started by spending about six months researching decision theory and AI safety, thinking I could logic my way out of a logic trap. Which is like trying to dig yourself out of a hole—theoretically possible, but mostly you just end up deeper in the hole."

"And then?"

"Then I accepted that some problems can't be solved, only managed. I developed what I call 'cognitive compartmentalization'—basically, I put the basilisk thoughts in a mental box labeled 'Stuff I'm Not Thinking About Right Now' and focus on other things. Like whether my students actually understand Nietzsche or just think he's the philosopher who said 'God is dead' and called it a day."

Alex looks skeptical. "That's it? Just... don't think about it?"

"Alex, have you ever tried not thinking about a pink elephant?"

"That's impossible."

"Exactly. So instead of trying not to think about the basilisk, I think about other things. Like how the university's new 'wellness initiative' somehow manages to be both mandatory and voluntary, or why the coffee in the faculty lounge tastes like it was filtered through a gym sock."

"That actually sounds like it might work," Alex says.

"It does work. Not perfectly, and not all the time, but it works. The key is accepting that having weird philosophical thoughts doesn't make you crazy—it makes you a philosopher. We're basically professional overthinkers. Weird thoughts are an occupational hazard."

Alex is quiet for a moment. "Professor Vasquez, what if the argument is actually correct?"

And there it is. The question I've been dreading for three years, the one that keeps me up at night doing probability calculations that would make a statistician cry.

"Alex," I say, channeling every ounce of professorial authority I possess, "that's exactly the question you need to learn not to ask. It's like asking 'What if I really am being followed by invisible spies?' The question itself is the problem."

## Scene 3: The Consultation (Tina Fey Style)

Dr. Sarah Kim's office looks like what would happen if Marie Kondo organized a therapist's workspace. Everything has a place, nothing is out of alignment, and somehow there are plants that look genuinely happy to be there. It's the kind of space that makes you feel like your life could be organized if you just tried hard enough, which is either inspiring or deeply depressing depending on your current mental state.

I'm going with "mildly optimistic" because I need Sarah's help, and walking into a therapy session with a bad attitude is like going to a restaurant and telling the waiter you hate food. Technically possible, but not strategically sound.

"Elena," Sarah says, looking up from her computer with the kind of genuine smile that makes you remember why you became friends with someone in the first place. "You look like you've been living on coffee and existential dread. What's going on?"

"I need a professional consultation," I say, settling into the chair that has probably absorbed more academic neuroses than a faculty meeting during budget season. "About a student. And about a situation that's basically unprecedented in the field of psychology."

Sarah's expression shifts from friendly concern to professional interest, which is like watching someone switch from yoga instructor to emergency room doctor. "Tell me more."

Here's the thing about explaining information hazards to a psychologist: it's like trying to explain social media to your grandmother. The concepts are familiar, but the scale and implications are completely outside normal experience.

"I have a student who's experiencing psychological distress caused by a philosophical argument," I begin. "Not distress about philosophy in general—which would be totally normal and probably healthy—but distress caused by the specific logical structure of one particular idea."

Sarah makes a note. "That's unusual. Philosophy students are typically pretty resilient to weird ideas."

"This is different. The idea appears to be designed—either intentionally or accidentally—to cause psychological harm in people who understand it. It's like a cognitive virus that specifically targets rational, morally-conscious individuals."

"You're talking about a memetic hazard," Sarah says, which makes me feel slightly better about the whole situation. At least I'm not the only one who knows this terminology.

"Exactly. And here's where it gets complicated—I've been dealing with the same information for three years."

Sarah's pen stops moving. "You're both affected by the same philosophical argument?"

"Correct."

"And you think this information spreads from person to person?"

"The evidence suggests it does. People who learn about it from affected individuals often develop similar symptoms. It's like the academic equivalent of a really contagious cold, except instead of sniffling, you get anxiety about artificial intelligence."

Sarah sets down her pen and leans back in her chair. I can see her processing this information with the kind of systematic thinking that made her good at psychology in the first place.

"Elena," she says slowly, "you're describing something that sounds like psychological warfare disguised as academic discourse."

"That's... actually a pretty accurate description," I admit. "Though I prefer to think of it as 'accidentally weaponized philosophy.' Sounds less intentionally evil."

"How many people are we talking about?"

"Hard to say. The affected population tends to avoid discussing it, partly because they're worried about spreading it and partly because it sounds completely insane when you try to explain it. It's like the first rule of Information Hazard Club is 'Don't talk about Information Hazard Club.'"

Sarah is quiet for a moment, and I can see her working through the professional implications. "If I'm going to help you, I need to understand what we're dealing with. But you're suggesting that understanding it might put me at risk for the same symptoms."

"That's the paradox," I confirm. "It's like asking someone to help you with a contagious disease by potentially giving them the disease. Except in this case, the disease is made of pure logic."

"And traditional therapeutic approaches?"

"Appear to be contraindicated. Cognitive behavioral therapy requires examining the problematic thoughts, but in this case, examination makes the problem worse. It's like trying to cure someone's fear of spiders by showing them more spiders, except the spiders are made of math."

Sarah picks up her pen again, then puts it down, then picks it up again. It's the kind of nervous fidgeting that means someone is about to make a decision they're not entirely comfortable with.

"This could be the most interesting case I've ever worked on," she says finally. "Or the most dangerous."

"Probably both," I agree.

She opens a new file on her computer and starts typing. "Okay, here's what we're going to do. I'm going to research cognitive isolation techniques—ways to treat anxiety and obsessive thoughts without engaging with their content. We'll develop indirect therapeutic approaches, establish containment protocols, and document everything."

"You're willing to help?"

Sarah looks up from her computer with a grin that's equal parts professional excitement and barely controlled academic curiosity. "Elena, I've spent my entire career treating normal psychological problems. This is the first time someone has walked into my office with a genuinely novel form of mental distress. I'm not passing this up."

"Even though it might be dangerous?"

"Especially because it might be dangerous," she says. "Besides, how often do you get to pioneer an entirely new field of therapy? I could be the first person to develop treatment protocols for philosophical information hazards. Do you know how good that would look on a grant application?"

I laugh, which feels good after three years of taking this problem entirely too seriously. "Sarah, you realize we might be about to attempt something that's never been done before?"

"Yeah," she says, saving her file and closing the computer. "Isn't it great?"
