# Drafts Folder

This folder contains draft posts and article ideas for Adam's Notebook. Use this space to develop content before publishing it to the main blog.

## Structure

- Use Markdown (`.md`) files for drafts
- Name files with a descriptive title: `article-title-slug.md`
- Include frontmatter at the top of each file with metadata

## Frontmatter Template

```yaml
---
title: "Article Title"
description: "Brief description of the article"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
status: draft|in-progress|ready
---
```

## Workflow

1. Create a new draft in this folder
2. Develop and refine the content
3. When ready, convert to HTML using the post template
4. Move to the appropriate date folder in `/posts/YYYY/MM/DD/`
5. Update index.html and posts.html with links to the new post
