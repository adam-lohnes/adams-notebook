# Building a Vanilla JS SPA: Lessons from Creating This Blog

## Introduction

- The current state of web development and framework fatigue
- Why I decided to build this blog with vanilla technologies
- The benefits and challenges of going "frameworkless"
- Overview of what this article will cover

## The Case for Vanilla JS in 2025

- The maturity of modern JavaScript and browser APIs
- Performance benefits of avoiding framework overhead
- Longevity and maintainability advantages
- Learning opportunities and deeper understanding
- When frameworks make sense vs. when they don't

## Core Architecture of This Blog

- Overall structure and organization
- The component-like approach without actual components
- How routing works without a router library
- Managing state without state management libraries
- The build process (or lack thereof)

## Key Implementation Details

### Routing and Navigation

- How I implemented client-side routing
- Handling browser history and URL changes
- Code snippets showing the routing implementation
- Performance considerations for page transitions

### Theming System

- Implementation of the light/dark theme toggle
- Using CSS variables for theme switching
- Persisting user preferences with localStorage
- Respecting system preferences with `prefers-color-scheme`

### Content Management

- How posts are organized and structured
- The templating approach for consistent layouts
- Strategies for content reuse across pages
- Automating repetitive tasks with simple scripts

### Performance Optimizations

- Lazy loading of non-critical resources
- Code splitting without a bundler
- Image optimization strategies
- Measuring and improving Core Web Vitals

## Challenges Faced and Solutions

- Browser compatibility issues and how I addressed them
- Debugging without framework tools
- Maintaining code organization without framework conventions
- Handling edge cases that frameworks typically solve

## Comparing with Framework Alternatives

- How this approach compares to React/Vue/Angular solutions
- What would be easier with a framework
- What was easier without a framework
- Performance comparisons with framework equivalents

## When to Choose Vanilla JS

- Project characteristics that make vanilla JS a good fit
- Warning signs that you might need a framework
- Hybrid approaches worth considering
- Decision framework for your next project

## Tools and Resources That Helped

- Useful vanilla JS utilities and micro-libraries
- Development tools that work well with vanilla projects
- Learning resources for mastering modern vanilla JS
- Testing approaches for vanilla JS applications

## Lessons Learned

- What I would do differently next time
- Unexpected benefits discovered along the way
- Skills improved by taking this approach
- How this experience changed my approach to frameworks

## Conclusion

- Final thoughts on the vanilla JS approach
- Recommendations for developers considering this path
- The future of vanilla JS development in an AI-assisted world
- Invitation for feedback and discussion
