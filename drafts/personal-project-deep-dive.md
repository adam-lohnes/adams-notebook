# Building a Personal Knowledge Management System: A Project Deep Dive

## Introduction

- The problem: Information overload and knowledge fragmentation
- The vision: A unified system for capturing, connecting, and retrieving knowledge
- Why I decided to build my own solution instead of using existing tools

## Project Requirements

- Seamless capture from multiple sources (web, books, conversations)
- Bidirectional linking between notes and concepts
- Spaced repetition for long-term retention
- AI-powered insights and connections
- Privacy-first approach with local-first storage
- Cross-platform availability

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: SQLite for local storage, optional sync with PostgreSQL
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API for semantic search and insights
- **Sync**: CRDTs for conflict-free replication
- **Deployment**: Electron for desktop, PWA for mobile

## Development Journey

### Phase 1: Core Note-Taking System

- Data model design for notes, tags, and connections
- Implementation of Markdown editor with bidirectional links
- Building the graph visualization for connected notes
- Challenges faced and solutions found

### Phase 2: Spaced Repetition Integration

- Research on optimal spaced repetition algorithms
- Implementation of the SM-2 algorithm
- Automatic extraction of potential review items
- UI for daily review sessions

### Phase 3: AI Augmentation

- Semantic search implementation
- Automatic tagging and categorization
- Connection suggestions based on content similarity
- Privacy considerations when using external AI services

### Phase 4: Cross-Platform Sync

- CRDT implementation for conflict resolution
- Encryption for secure sync
- Offline-first approach
- Performance optimizations for large knowledge bases

## Technical Deep Dives

### The Graph Data Structure

- How notes and connections are represented
- Query optimization for fast graph traversal
- Visualization techniques for complex knowledge graphs

### Embedding Generation and Semantic Search

- Vector embeddings for note content
- Locality-sensitive hashing for efficient similarity search
- Hybrid search combining full-text and semantic approaches

### Spaced Repetition Algorithm

- Mathematical model behind the SM-2 algorithm
- Adaptations made for different types of knowledge
- Performance metrics and retention improvements

## Lessons Learned

- The complexity of building a "simple" note-taking app
- Balancing features with simplicity
- The importance of dogfooding your own product
- Technical debt and refactoring decisions
- Performance optimizations that mattered most

## Current State and Future Directions

- Current usage statistics and patterns
- Planned features and improvements
- Potential open-source release considerations
- Integration with other tools and workflows

## How It's Changed My Work
