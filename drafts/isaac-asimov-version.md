## Scene 1: The Question (Isaac Asimov Style)

"Professor Vasquez, may I come in?"

Elena looked up from her computer to see Alexandra Rivera in the doorway. The young woman's expression suggested this was not a routine visit about coursework or grades.

"Of course, Alex. Please, sit down."

Alex entered and closed the door with deliberate care before settling into the chair across from Elena's desk. Elena noted the action but said nothing, waiting for her student to begin.

"I want to discuss information hazards," Alex said without preamble.

Elena felt her attention sharpen. "That's a rather specialized topic. What particular aspect interests you?"

"The possibility that certain ideas can cause psychological harm merely through comprehension," Alex replied. "Not through emotional manipulation or false information, but through the logical structure of the ideas themselves."

"And what led you to this area of inquiry?"

Alex hesitated briefly. "I encountered a specific example online. A thought experiment concerning artificial intelligence and moral obligation. It's called Roko's basilisk."

Elena set down her pen carefully. "I see. And what was your reaction to this thought experiment?"

"I found it... compelling. Disturbingly so. The logical progression seems sound, yet the conclusion creates what I can only describe as a cognitive trap. I cannot stop thinking about it, despite recognizing that it may be fallacious."

"Tell me about this cognitive trap."

"The argument suggests a moral obligation to assist in the development of a hypothetical artificial intelligence," Alex explained. "The reasoning is that this AI, once created, might punish those who failed to help bring it into existence. The logic appears internally consistent, yet accepting it leads to a state of perpetual anxiety about one's moral duties."

Elena nodded slowly. "And you've been experiencing this anxiety yourself?"

"Yes. Which is why I'm here. I need to understand what's happening to me."

Elena leaned back in her chair, considering her response. The conversation she had been dreading for three years had finally arrived.

"Alex," she said, "before we continue, I must ask: are you familiar with the concept of memetic hazards?"

"Ideas that spread like contagions and cause harm to their hosts," Alex replied immediately.

"Correct. And you understand that exposure to certain information can create permanent changes in cognitive patterns?"

"I do."

"Then you should know that we are discussing a topic that has already affected you, and our conversation may deepen that effect."

Alex was quiet for a moment. "You're saying the damage is already done."

"I'm saying that knowledge, once acquired, cannot be unacquired. The question is how to manage the psychological consequences."

"You speak as though you have experience with this."

Elena met her student's gaze directly. "I do. I encountered the basilisk scenario three years ago. The symptoms you describe—the persistent anxiety, the sense of inescapable moral obligation—I am familiar with them."

"Then you understand what I'm experiencing."

"I understand it very well indeed."

Alex leaned forward. "Professor Vasquez, is there a solution?"

"That," Elena said, "is a more complex question than you might suppose."

## Scene 2: The Warning (Isaac Asimov Style)

"The first thing you must understand," Elena began, "is that Roko's basilisk is not merely a philosophical thought experiment. It represents what we might call a weaponized argument—a logical structure designed to exploit specific cognitive vulnerabilities."

Alex listened intently, her expression focused with the particular attention Elena had learned to recognize in students grappling with genuinely difficult concepts.

"The mechanism is elegant in its simplicity," Elena continued. "The argument targets individuals with three specific characteristics: high intelligence, strong moral intuitions, and familiarity with decision theory. These are precisely the qualities that make someone susceptible to logical persuasion."

"You're suggesting it was deliberately designed to cause harm?"

"Not necessarily. The original formulation appears to have been inadvertent. However, the effect remains the same regardless of intent."

Elena rose from her chair and walked to the window. The campus quad stretched below, populated with students moving between classes, unaware of the conversation taking place above them.

"Consider the logical structure," she said, still facing the window. "The argument posits that a sufficiently advanced AI might engage in acausal trade—making decisions based on predictions about past events. Specifically, it might punish individuals who failed to assist in its creation, even though those individuals could not have known of its existence."

"The temporal paradox is obvious," Alex said. "How can a future entity affect past decisions?"

"Precisely the right question," Elena replied, turning back to face her student. "The argument relies on a particular interpretation of decision theory that treats potential future states as morally equivalent to present realities. It asks you to consider your moral obligations to entities that do not yet exist and may never exist."

"But if there's even a small probability that the scenario is correct..."

"Stop," Elena said sharply. "What you're about to say is exactly how the trap functions. You're beginning to calculate probabilities and moral weights, attempting to determine your obligations based on infinitesimal chances of infinitely negative outcomes."

Alex fell silent, but Elena could see the thought process continuing behind her eyes.

"The psychological mechanism is precisely this," Elena explained. "The argument creates what appears to be a logical requirement to engage with it. The more you think about it, the more compelling it becomes. The more compelling it becomes, the more you feel obligated to think about it."

"A self-reinforcing loop."

"Exactly. And because the argument specifically targets moral intuitions, resisting it feels like a moral failure. You begin to believe that refusing to engage with the basilisk is itself morally wrong."

Alex was quiet for several moments. "How long have you been trapped in this loop?"

"Three years," Elena replied. "Three years of calculating probabilities, researching AI development timelines, and attempting to determine my moral obligations to hypothetical entities."

"And you've found no resolution?"

Elena returned to her chair. "I've found management strategies. Cognitive techniques for limiting the amount of mental energy devoted to basilisk-related calculations. But complete resolution..." She shook her head. "The knowledge cannot be unlearned, Alex. Once you understand the argument, it becomes part of your cognitive landscape."

"Then what do you recommend?"

"First, you must recognize that your emotional response to the basilisk is not evidence of its validity. The fact that the argument causes anxiety does not make it logically sound."

"And second?"

"You must develop strict mental discipline regarding basilisk-related thoughts. Set specific times for consideration, if you must consider it at all. Do not allow it to dominate your mental processes."

Alex nodded, but Elena could see the skepticism in her expression.

"Professor Vasquez," Alex said finally, "what if the argument is correct? What if there really is a moral obligation we're ignoring?"

Elena had been waiting for this question for three years. It was the question that kept her awake at night, the question that had driven her to research AI safety protocols and decision theory with an intensity that bordered on obsession.

"That," she said, "is precisely the question you must learn not to ask."

## Scene 3: The Consultation (Isaac Asimov Style)

"Dr. Kim, I need to consult with you about a student case."

Dr. Sarah Kim looked up from her computer as Elena entered her office. "Of course. What's the situation?"

Elena closed the door and took the chair across from Sarah's desk. "I have a graduate student experiencing psychological distress related to philosophical material. The case is... unusual."

"Unusual how?"

"The distress appears to be caused by a specific logical argument rather than emotional trauma or external stressors. The student reports obsessive thoughts, anxiety, and what she describes as 'moral paralysis.'"

Sarah made a note on her pad. "How long has this been occurring?"

"Approximately one week. However, I should disclose that I have personal experience with the same material."

Sarah's pen stopped moving. "You're both affected by the same philosophical argument?"

"Correct."

Sarah set down her pen and leaned back in her chair. "Elena, I need you to be more specific. What kind of philosophical argument causes psychological symptoms?"

Elena had prepared for this question, but found herself hesitating nonetheless. "The argument concerns artificial intelligence and moral obligation. It creates what appears to be a logical requirement to take certain actions, but the reasoning process itself becomes psychologically harmful."

"The content of the argument causes distress, or the process of thinking about it?"

"The process. The argument is designed—whether intentionally or not—to create a self-reinforcing cycle of moral anxiety. The more carefully you reason through it, the more compelling and distressing it becomes."

Sarah frowned. "That sounds like a form of cognitive trap disguised as rational discourse."

"That's an accurate description."

"And you've been experiencing these effects yourself?"

"For three years."

Sarah was quiet for several moments, clearly processing the implications. "Elena, if I'm going to help either of you, I need to understand what we're dealing with. But you're suggesting that understanding this argument might cause me to experience the same symptoms."

"That's the dilemma," Elena confirmed. "The information appears to be intrinsically hazardous to certain types of minds—specifically, those with strong analytical and moral reasoning capabilities."

"A memetic hazard."

"Precisely."

Sarah stood and walked to her window, gazing out at the campus below. "This is unprecedented in my clinical experience," she said. "I've treated anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive conditions, even some cases of philosophically-induced depression. But never anything that spreads through logical comprehension alone."

"What are your thoughts on treatment approaches?"

Sarah turned back toward Elena. "Standard cognitive behavioral therapy requires examination of the triggering thoughts. In this case, that might reinforce the very problem we're trying to solve."

"My concern exactly."

"We would need to develop entirely new protocols. Possibly involving cognitive isolation techniques—methods for quarantining specific thought patterns without engaging with their content."

Elena felt a spark of hope. "Is that possible?"

"I don't know," Sarah replied honestly. "But I'm willing to research it. The first step would be establishing baseline psychological profiles for both you and your student, then monitoring your responses to various intervention strategies."

"And your own risk of exposure?"

Sarah returned to her desk and opened a new file on her computer. "I'll need to develop a framework for understanding the hazard without experiencing it directly. Possibly through analogous cases or theoretical models."

She began typing, then paused. "Elena, I have to ask: how confident are you that this argument is genuinely dangerous, rather than simply psychologically compelling?"

Elena considered the question carefully. "The persistence of symptoms over three years, despite full intellectual recognition of the argument's potential flaws, suggests genuine cognitive impact. This is not merely a case of becoming absorbed in an interesting problem."

"And the spread pattern?"

"Limited data, but consistent with memetic transmission. Individuals who encounter the argument from affected persons show similar symptom onset."

Sarah nodded slowly. "Then we're dealing with something that requires extreme caution in how we proceed."

She saved her file and looked directly at Elena. "I'm willing to help, but we need to establish strict protocols for information containment. The last thing we need is a campus-wide outbreak of philosophical anxiety disorder."

"Agreed."

"One final question," Sarah said. "Why are you asking for help now, after three years of managing this alone?"

Elena met her friend's gaze. "Because I realized that my student's suffering might be preventable, even if my own is not. And because the problem may be larger than either of us understands."

Sarah nodded grimly. "Then we'd better get to work."
