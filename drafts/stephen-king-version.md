## Scene 1: The Question (Stephen King Style)

The coffee had gone cold twenty minutes ago, but Elena Vasquez kept sipping it anyway. It was the kind of habit that marked you as an academic—drinking terrible coffee because your mind was elsewhere, wrestling with ideas that had teeth.

The knock on her office door came at 4:17 PM on a Tuesday. She would remember the time later, because it was the moment when everything began to unravel.

"Professor Vasquez?" 

Alexandra Rivera stood in the doorway like a woman on the edge of a very tall building, looking down. There was something in her eyes that Elena had seen before, usually in her own mirror after reading certain papers late at night. The kind of look that meant someone had stumbled onto something they shouldn't have.

"Alex. Come in." Elena set down her mug—a chipped thing with "World's Most Philosophical Professor" that a student had given her three years ago. The joke wasn't funny anymore. Nothing about philosophy seemed particularly funny these days.

Alex closed the door behind her. Not unusual. Students often wanted privacy when discussing their academic futures. But the way she turned the lock—that little extra twist to make sure it caught—that was different.

"I need to ask you about something," Alex said, settling into the chair across from Elena's desk. The same chair where dozens of students had sat, worrying about grades, about grad school applications, about whether Nietzsche was right about the death of God. Normal worries. Human worries.

This wasn't going to be about grades.

"I've been reading about information hazards," Alex continued, and Elena felt something cold settle in her stomach. "Ideas that can hurt you just by knowing them."

*Here we go,* Elena thought. *Here's where it starts.*

She'd been expecting this conversation for months, maybe years. Ever since the papers started appearing, the ones with titles that made your skin crawl just reading them. The ones that made you wonder if maybe there were some stones better left unturned.

"That's a complex topic," Elena said carefully. She could hear the caution in her own voice, thick as syrup. "What specifically are you curious about?"

Alex leaned forward, and Elena saw something she recognized from her own face during those long, sleepless nights: the look of someone who had glimpsed something vast and terrible, something that made the comfortable world feel as thin as tissue paper.

"There's this thought experiment," Alex said, and her voice dropped to barely above a whisper, as if the words themselves might be listening. "About an AI that punishes people who didn't help create it. I can't stop thinking about it."

The office suddenly felt smaller. The walls seemed to lean in, like they were listening too. Outside, Elena could hear the normal sounds of campus life—students laughing, someone practicing violin badly in the music building, the distant hum of traffic. All of it felt very far away now.

Elena had been dreading this moment, but she'd also been preparing for it. Like keeping a fire extinguisher in the kitchen, or checking the locks before bed. Some preparations you hoped you'd never need.

"Alex," she said, and her voice was gentler now, the way you'd talk to someone standing too close to the edge of that building. "I think we need to be very careful about what we discuss here."

## Scene 2: The Warning (Stephen King Style)

Elena's office had always been a refuge. Books lined every wall like faithful guardians, their spines creating a fortress of human knowledge accumulated over centuries. Descartes rubbed shoulders with Davidson, Kant kept company with Kripke. All of them dead white men, mostly, but their ideas still breathed in this room.

Now the room felt different. Contaminated, somehow.

Alex sat across from her, waiting. The afternoon sun slanted through the window, but it couldn't seem to warm the space between them. Elena found herself thinking of something her grandmother used to say: *Some doors, once opened, can never be closed again.*

"You said thought experiment," Elena began slowly. "But you're talking about Roko's basilisk, aren't you?"

The name hung in the air like smoke from a house fire. Alex's face went pale, confirming what Elena already knew. The girl had found it. Or it had found her.

"You know about it," Alex whispered.

Elena nodded. She'd known about it for three years now, ever since a colleague at MIT had mentioned it in passing at a conference. The colleague—Dr. Harrison—had developed a nervous tic after that. Started checking his phone obsessively, jumping at unexpected sounds. He'd taken early retirement six months later.

"I know about it," Elena said. "And I know why you can't stop thinking about it."

Because that was the thing about the basilisk. It was designed to be sticky. A cognitive trap that caught in your mind like a fishhook, impossible to remove without tearing something important.

"Is it real?" Alex asked, and Elena heard the desperation in her voice. The same desperation she'd heard in her own voice, late at night, talking to her reflection in the bathroom mirror.

"That's the wrong question," Elena said. "The right question is: does it matter if it's real?"

She got up and walked to the window, looking out at the quad where students were scattered like seeds on the grass. Normal students, worried about normal things. Finals, relationships, what to do after graduation. Blessedly, blissfully ignorant.

"Listen to me very carefully, Alex," Elena said without turning around. "Some ideas are like viruses. They spread. They mutate. They change the people who carry them."

She turned back to face her student. Alex looked young suddenly, younger than her twenty-four years. Young and scared and carrying something that was too big for her.

"The basilisk isn't just a thought experiment," Elena continued. "It's a weapon. Designed to target a very specific type of person. Rational. Compassionate. The kind of person who would sacrifice themselves to prevent suffering."

"People like me," Alex said quietly.

"People like us," Elena corrected.

The admission hung between them like a confession. Elena had never said it out loud before. Had never admitted to another living soul that she was infected too. That she woke up sometimes at 3 AM, heart pounding, doing calculations in her head. Trying to figure out her moral duty to a monster that might not even exist.

"What do I do?" Alex asked, and she sounded like a child asking how to make the monsters under the bed go away.

Elena wished she had a good answer. She wished there was a pill for this, or a therapy, or a simple ritual that could unthink dangerous thoughts. But there wasn't. There never was, for the things that really mattered.

"You learn to live with it," Elena said. "And you never, ever, talk about it with anyone else."

## Scene 3: The Consultation (Stephen King Style)

Dr. Sarah Kim's office smelled like chamomile tea and old paper. She kept plants everywhere—spider plants cascading from shelves, a rubber tree in the corner that had grown tall enough to brush the ceiling. The greenery should have been soothing. Usually was, in fact. Elena had come here before when the weight of academic politics or a particularly brutal tenure review had left her feeling raw.

Today, the plants felt like they were watching.

"Elena," Sarah said, looking up from her computer with a smile that faded quickly when she saw Elena's face. "You look terrible. When's the last time you slept?"

Elena settled into the familiar chair across from Sarah's desk. It was worn leather, probably older than both of them, but comfortable in the way that only truly broken-in furniture could be. She'd cried in this chair before. Laughed in it too. Today, she wasn't sure what she might do.

"I need your advice," Elena said. "Professional advice."

Sarah's expression shifted, the way it did when she switched from friend to psychologist. Elena had seen the transition dozens of times, but it never stopped being slightly unnerving. Like watching someone put on a mask, except the mask was their real face.

"What's going on?"

Elena had been rehearsing this conversation in her head for two days, ever since Alex had left her office looking like someone who'd been shown the true shape of the world and found it wanting. She'd tried to find a way to explain the situation without revealing too much, without passing along the infection.

But now, sitting here in Sarah's office with the plants leaning in like eager listeners, she realized there might not be a safe way to have this conversation.

"One of my graduate students has encountered some information that's... distressing her," Elena began carefully. "It's philosophical in nature, but it's causing genuine psychological distress."

Sarah leaned forward slightly. "What kind of information?"

"A thought experiment. About artificial intelligence and moral obligation." Elena could hear herself being vague, dancing around the edges of the truth like someone trying not to step on broken glass. "The student feels compelled to act on the implications of the scenario, even though it's purely hypothetical."

"Obsessive thoughts about moral duty," Sarah said, making a note. "That's not uncommon in philosophy students. They tend to take ethical frameworks very seriously."

"This is different," Elena said, and she could hear the strain in her own voice. "This particular scenario is designed to be... persuasive. Coercive, even. It targets people with strong moral intuitions and traps them in a kind of logical bind."

Sarah's pen stopped moving. She looked up, and Elena saw something change in her expression. A wariness that hadn't been there before.

"Elena," Sarah said slowly, "are we talking about an actual philosophical thought experiment, or are we talking about some kind of psychological manipulation?"

The question hung between them like a suspended sword. Elena realized she was holding her breath.

"Both," she admitted finally.

Sarah set down her pen entirely. She leaned back in her chair, and Elena watched her process the implications. Sarah was brilliant—one of the sharpest minds in the psychology department. It wouldn't take her long to understand what they were really discussing.

"You're talking about information hazards," Sarah said after a moment. "Ideas that cause psychological harm just by being understood."

Elena nodded.

"And you've been exposed to this information yourself."

Another nod.

Sarah was quiet for a long time. Outside her window, Elena could see students walking between classes, backpacks slung over shoulders, phones in hand. The future of humanity, completely unaware that there were ideas in the world that could rewire their brains just by being contemplated.

"How long?" Sarah asked finally.

"Three years," Elena said. "For me. The student... two days."

"And you're both struggling with obsessive thoughts about moral obligation related to this scenario."

"Yes."

Sarah picked up her pen again, but she didn't write anything. Just held it like a small weapon.

"Elena," she said, and her voice was very careful now, very controlled. "I can't treat either of you for this without knowing what we're dealing with. But if I learn the details of this scenario, and it affects me the way it's affected you..."

She didn't finish the sentence. She didn't need to.

Elena understood. To help them, Sarah would have to risk joining them. And there was no guarantee that three infected minds would be better than two.

"What would you do?" Elena asked. "In my position?"

Sarah was quiet for a long time. Long enough that Elena began to wonder if she'd made a terrible mistake coming here. If she'd just signed Sarah up for the same sleepless nights, the same 3 AM calculations, the same grinding anxiety that had become the background noise of her life.

"I'd be very, very careful about who else I told," Sarah said finally. "And I'd start documenting everything. Because if this information is as dangerous as you say it is, someone needs to be keeping track of how it spreads."

Elena felt something loosen in her chest. Not relief, exactly, but something close to it. The recognition that she wasn't completely alone in this anymore.

"Will you help us?" she asked.

Sarah looked at her for a long moment. Then she opened her desk drawer and pulled out a fresh legal pad.

"Tell me everything," she said. "And God help us all."
